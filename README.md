# Haki Gym Exercises

Haki Gym Exercises is a responsive React-based fitness web app that allows users to explore workout routines by body part, view detailed exercise information, and watch video tutorials powered by the APIs. The app is built for frontend practice and API handling, inspired by the spirit of *Haki* from the anime **One Piece**, symbolizing willpower, discipline, and strength.

## Inspiration

The name **Haki** is inspired by the anime *One Piece*, representing inner strength and determination. Just like the characters train to master their Haki, this app is a tool to help users master their physical strength through guided exercise routines.
