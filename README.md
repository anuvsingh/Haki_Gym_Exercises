# 💪 Haki Gym Exercises

Haki Gym Exercises is a responsive React-based fitness web app that allows users to explore workout routines by body part, view detailed exercise information, and watch video tutorials powered by the APIs. The app is built for frontend practice and API handling, inspired by the spirit of *Haki* from the anime **One Piece**, symbolizing willpower, discipline, and strength.

## ✨ Inspiration
